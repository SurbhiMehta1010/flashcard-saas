Do to:

-api routes for stripe and openai (idk if there is a cost for openai api keys, the key i generated doesnt seem to work) I think we just have to add the keys to the .env.local file for stripe api keys and and ai api key

-`app/page.js` this file

-`app/result/page.js` this file 

- and then the sign in page: `app/sign-in/[[â€¦sign-in]]/page.js`
